This repository contains projects for Udacity's Predictive Analytics for Business Nanodegree: https://www.udacity.com/course/predictive-analytics-for-business-nanodegree--nd008t
# Part 1: Problem Solving with Advanced Analytics
Learn a structured framework for solving problems with advanced analytics. Learn to select the most appropriate analytical methodology. 
Also was introduced both Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression.

## Predicting Diamond Prices
This project is designed for three main reasons:

- To give you a feel for what you’ll be doing throughout the Nanodegree Program
- To introduce you to Udacity’s project submission and review process
- To make sure you feel comfortable with the basics before you begin. If it feels too easy, don't worry. We have some great stuff in store for you.

## Project Overview
A jewelry company wants to put in a bid to purchase a large set of diamonds, but is unsure how much it should bid. In this project, you will use the results from a predictive model to make a recommendation on how much the jewelry company should bid for the diamonds.

## US Number System
All numbers that will be presented in this Nanodegree program will be based on the US numbering system where 5,269 is "five thousand two hundred sixty nine" and 158.1 is "one hundred fifty eight point one" where 1 is a decimal number. This is very important so please take note of this.

## Project Details
A diamond distributor has recently decided to exit the market and has put up a set of 3,000 diamonds up for auction. Seeing this as a great opportunity to expand its inventory, a jewelry company has shown interest in making a bid. To decide how much to bid, the company’s analytics team used a large database of diamond prices to build a linear regression model to predict the price of a diamond based on its attributes. You, as the business analysts, are tasked to apply that model to make a recommendation for how much the company should bid for the entire set of 3,000 diamonds.

The following diagram represents the analysis at a high level. Since the model is already built, your analysis will focus on the right side of the diagram.
# Part 2: Data Wrangling
Data Wrangling is at the core of all data activity. In this course you learn how to work with different data types,dirty data, and outliers. 
You will also learn how to reformat data and join data from different sources together.
# Part 3: Classification Models
Classification models are a powerful tool for business analyst. In this course, you learn more about binary and non-binary classification models 
and how to use them to drive business insights.
# Part 4: A/B Testing
Helping businesses make the best decisions is an essential part of Business Analysis. Planning and executing the analysis of an AB test allow 
you to provide confident recommendations. In this course, you learn how to create, execute, and analyze an AB test.
# Part 5: Time Series Forecasting
Time Series Forecasting is a powerful analytical tool. In this course, you learn how ETS and ARIMA models are used to forecast data and 
how they deal with trends and seasonality. These skills will be evaluated in the final project.
# Part 6: Segmentation and Clustering
Segmentation and Clustering are effective methods for finding patterns in your data. In this course, you learn how to prepare data to be 
clustered appropriately and interpret results.
